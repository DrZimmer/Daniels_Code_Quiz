Module 4 Challenge

## Challenge 4 Description

No code was given for the creation of my own quiz.
Thanks to Qing (TA) for her help.

- On opening, user is presented with a description, a high scores link to highscores.html, and a start quiz button that will start the quiz/timer
- A question and four answers are presented.
- When an answer button is clicked, an alert tells you if the answer is right or wrong, clicking ok will continue to the next question.
- If you get the answer wrong, 10 seconds are subtracted from the time remaining (75 to start). Final time = final score.
- When the last question is answered (or time <= 0>) then you can enter and submit your initials. (This will submit to local storage).
- After submitting you will be taken to the highscores.html where all previous attempts will be listed (local storage)
